First we thought about moving the files in a folder corresponding to their website, but it would be a waste of time and a big computational effort. Thus, we came up with a (probably) faster solution : we could simply write the name of the file within its corresponding website folder. By inspecting the files, we saw that the first line was always containing a comment with the name of the file and the complete website. Using readlines and split, we could easily retrieve the name of the website.\n",

We will test a couple of methods for feature extraction, but first of all, a good approach is to analyze the correlations between our variables.\n",

Then, we have to suppress all the rare ingredients (the ingredients which appear only a small number of times in our dataset).\n",

Ideally, we would set the weigth as $\\frac{ingredient\\_mass}{sum\\_of\\_ingredient\\_mass}$.
