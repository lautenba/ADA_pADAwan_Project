- Fix the readme to comply with the milestone 2
	- dates
	- add more description

- Remove useless prints :
	- in scrap.py
	- in website_func
	- in project.ipynb
	
- Try to scrap the quantities also :
	- search the most frequent quantity words (kilos, cup, ...)
	- convert all these words in unique unity (kilos for every one)
	- if some unities doesn't appear in the most frequent quantitiy words, maybe we can just remove the recipe...

- Do features Selection and explain why

- Create train and validation sets

- Implement 1 one linear model
	- create model
	- train
	- choice of hyperparamet
	- save it (graph, weights)

- Implement more complex models
	- create model
	- train
	- choice of hyperparamet
	- save it (graph, weights)	

- Analysis

- Maybe create graph with networkx
- Clean the code
- Fix the readme for the milestone 3
