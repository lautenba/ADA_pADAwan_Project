# Title

# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

What defines a successful recipe? There are a million different meals that have different popularities, and we each have our favorite ones. However, a lot of meals are objectively appreciated across a large part of the population… But what could be the origin of this attractiveness? Our goal is to investigate every variable that could have an impact on the success of the recipe, such as the ingredients, the type of meal (main course, dessert, …), time to prepare it, etc … We plan to use the dataset “Cooking recipes” which provides a ranking of the recipe as well as a lot of interesting variables. We will investigate the relations between these variables and the ranking of the recipe. Based on our analysis, we will create a model that is able to predict the ranking of a random recipe. We will also try to see if this model is able to create new recipes by using the optimal parameters found during the analysis.



# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

For our project, we will focus on the following questions:

- Trends of food production over the years and search for correlations with the popularity of different recipes.

- Is there an increase|decrease in the use of some ingredients in the recent years ? If so, why ?

- From where does the rating of the recipe come from ? Ingredients, time, combination between ingredients, what type of meal (main course, dessert), originality, (try to predict some "ideal recipes by interpolating) ?
